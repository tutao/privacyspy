  "In order to be able to evaluate campaigns with partners and advertising campaigns (e.g. advertising via Google or other search engines), we store an ID of the campaign with your Tutanota account when you reach Tutanota via a campaign link and register a Tutanota account. To be able to assign returning users to a campaign, we store a cryptographic hash of the IP address and the user agent (including information about the user’s browser and operating system) together with the campaign ID when you visit our website via a campaign link. If you visit our website via a search query and an advertising campaign, we also store the keywords and the search query together with the hash and the campaign ID.
